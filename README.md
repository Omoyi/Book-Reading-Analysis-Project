# Book Reading Data Analysis Project

## 1. Project Overview

A python data analysis project using a dataset from pewresearch.org on book reading behaviors from March 7 - April 4, 2016 after interviewing people between the ages of 16 - 95 in the US. 

**My main objectives in this analysis are**: 
- To determine and compare the average number of books read annually across different age groups and analyze this data to identify any a decline in reading frequency over time. 

- To identify how generational preferences for different book formats, such as print, e-books, and audiobooks, may correlate with changes in reading frequency. 

- To present these findings through clear and compelling visualizations to provide actionable insights into generational reading trends. 

## 2. Instructions

### **2.1 Tools Used**

* **Python (Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Panda, and Seaborn libraries):** For initial data loading and preparation.
* **Power BI:** For visualization, dashboard design, and interactive analysis.

### **2.2 Cloning Requirements**

1. Make sure you set up your environment and have all the libraries/languages listed above installed.
2. Download the book reading dataset from Pew research: https://www.pewresearch.org/dataset/march-2016-libraries/
3. The dataset is only downloadable after you create an account using your organization/institution email.
4. Run ``git clone https://github.com/Omoyi/Book-Reading-Analysis-Project.git`` in your terminal/command line
4. After forking or cloning this project first run the code in the first jupyter notebook because it is the only one in which I imported panda and loaded the data frame. If you run other notebook segments before running the first one you might get an error about the dataFrame not being defined.
